Boise loves to be on lists: [Top places for families](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanriper/2012/04/04/the-best-cities-for-raising-a-family/), [Most adventurous state](http://www.adventure-journal.com/2013/04/poll-whats-the-best-adventure-state/), and even [most sexually active city](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He20hfDgLMk).

Yet in spite of this, the lion's share of software development still rests in the confines of .NET and Java communities.  Fast rising languages like Ruby have yet to develop a solid base in the valley, but it's time than now to change that.

Ruby, at it's core, is centered around _developer happiness_.  That's not something you read very often, and the community surrounding Ruby is one of it's biggest strong suits (although there are countless others).  As a Boise State professor put it: "The smaller languages have great documentation, excellent community, and fantastic resources... because they have a lot more to prove."  

His intention was a means to call languages like Ruby and Python upstarts against the "tried and true" juggernauts, but the fact of the matter is the tech world is changing. Everyone from enterprising startups to massive juggernauts use Ruby based web stacks... Twitter, Groupon, Hulu, and Github to name a few.  _This blog just happens to be written in Ruby too!_

First and foremost, learning to develop with Ruby saves time.  Tim O'Reilly, founder of O'Reilly media put it pretty convincingly: "Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.  Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months to develop can be produced in a matter of days."

Localmotion's mission is to be a powerful source for new and experienced developers in learning and becoming more proficient at Ruby.  From weekly drinkup events (Monthly Brewby) to weekend workshops aimed at beginners, there's no time like the present to start learning.

Our first Brewby will be happening soon!
