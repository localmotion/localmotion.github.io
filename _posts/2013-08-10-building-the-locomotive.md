Conventional wisdom says the hardest step is the first, but when building a thriving community, it's also the most trivial.

A growing portion of Boise's business community have been identifying Boise has the 'next great startup town', but the fact is that talk is cheap.  The ideas that will break the city out of it's Chicken/Egg debate of how to foster organic tech growth won't come from the many resources available to local businesses, or from the Universities, or from the Public Sector.  If we want Boise to become the best place to both live _and_ pursue our dreams of successful tech startups, the movement must start with us: the developers, designers, and visionairies.

Many of the larger corporations in Boise have thrown in the towel on "local talent", and indeed many of the most talented and intelligent people I've met all chant the same cynicism when it comes to Boise even _having_ a startup community.

LocalMotion seeks to change that.

Starting soon, monthly meetups, drinkups, and workshops will take form as a way to combat the status quo to show both the Boise leadership and ourselves just how many capable, inspiring, and passionate individuals want to make Boise's startup community the envy of all.
